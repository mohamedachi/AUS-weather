# AUSWeather Machine Learning Project

This project is part of a Machine Learning Certificate course.  
It uses weather data from Australia to build predictive models using Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AUSWeather_Project.git
   cd AUSWeather_Project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook FinalProject_AUSWeather.ipynb
   ```

## 📂 Project Structure

- `FinalProject_AUSWeather.ipynb` → Main notebook with all exercises
- `requirements.txt` → List of required Python packages
- `README.md` → Setup instructions and project details

## 📊 Models Implemented
- Random Forest Classifier (with feature importances)
- Logistic Regression (with GridSearchCV)

## 📈 Results
- Feature importance extraction from Random Forest
- Performance comparison between Random Forest and Logistic Regression
